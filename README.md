# dataStructures

Practice with data structures and algorithms in Javascript and Python.

These problems come from a variety of sources, including Interview Cake, Cracking the Coding Interview, Hack Reactor, Codewars, and real interviews.  All the solutions are my own. Some are more elegant than others.

My particular favorites include Making Change, Count K Difference Instances, Biggest Increase, and Largest Product of Three.
