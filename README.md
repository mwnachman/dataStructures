# dataStructures

Practice with data structures and algorithms in Javascript and Python.

These problems come from a variety of sources, including Interview Cake, Cracking the Coding Interview, 
Hack Reactor, Codewars, and real interviews.  All the solutions are my own; some are more elegant than others.

My particular favorites include Making Change, Count K Difference Instances, Array Product, Biggest Increase, and Largest Product of Three.

For the Javascript files, if there are tests in a file, just pop the name of the file into line 11 of index.html to run the them in the console.
