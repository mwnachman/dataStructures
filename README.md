# dataStructures

My practice with data structures and algorithms in preparation for coding interviews.  
These problems are from Interview Cake, Cracking the Coding Interview, Hack Reactor,
Code Wars, and real interviews.  All the solutions are my own.  Some are more elegant than others.

My particular favorites include Making Change, Count K Difference Instances, Array Product, Biggest Increase, and Largest Product of Three.
